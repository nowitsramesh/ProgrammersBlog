## JavaScript

# Closures

The ability to treat functions as values combined with the fact that local binding are re-created every time a function is called, brings up an interesting question.
Closure - being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope. MM: Think functions as values with code in their body and the environment in which they are created.

# Pure functions
Specific kind of value producing function that not only produces no side-affects but doesn't rely on side effects from other code, for exapmple it doesn't read global bindings whose values might change.

# Factory functions
Any function which is not a class or constructor that returns (presumably new) a object. In javascript any function can return a object when it does without a 'new' keyword it is a factory function. The offer the ability to produce a new object without diving into the complexities of class and new keyword.

# Arrow functions
Arrow functions have implicit return feature.

# Type inference 
Is the process of inferring types based on the context in which they are used.
