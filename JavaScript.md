# Closures

The ability to treat functions as values combined with the fact that local binding are re-created every time a function is called, brings up an interesting question.
Closure - being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope. MM: Think functions as values with code in their body and the environment in which they are created.

# Pure functions
Specific kind of value producing function that not only produces no side-affects but doesn't rely on side effects from other code, for exapmple it doesn't read global bindings whose values might change.
